# README

[Kittens API](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/kittens-api) from the Ruby on Rails Track via The Odin Project.

## GOAL
In this warmup, you’ll get a chance to poke around with an existing API from Flickr. You’ll need to read the documentation to understand which calls to make but they have a nice API explorer tool which submits API calls on your behalf.
